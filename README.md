What is Tamatem ID?

Tamatem ID is a user identity for the Tamatem player which provides two primary functions:

Authentication: The process of verifying a Tamatem identity. This is typically achieved via an email or a mobile number and password. This ensures that players are who they claim to be before granting them access to their accounts.
Authorization: Once authenticated, the Tamatem platform then asks and determines what resources and data need to be accessed from the player’s Tamatem ID account. This level of control is essential to maintain the security of user data, the integrity of the system, and the next steps through the integration.
